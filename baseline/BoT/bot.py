Buffer of Thoughts (BoT) Implementation.

BoT is a thought-augmented reasoning framework with three core components:

    1. Problem Distiller  — extracts key variables, constraints, and a
                            high-level task description from the raw question.

    2. Meta-Buffer        — a lightweight in-memory (or file-backed) library of
                            generalised *thought-templates* organised into six
                            categories: Text Comprehension, Creative Language
                            Generation, Common Sense Reasoning, Mathematical
                            Reasoning, Code Programming, Application Scheduling.

    3. Buffer Manager     — after every solve, distils a new thought-template
                            from the (distilled problem, solution) pair and
                            conditionally inserts it into the meta-buffer if it
                            is sufficiently novel (similarity < threshold δ).

Bugs fixed from original document version
──────────────────────────────────────────
    A. BufferManager: removed @property decorators that shadowed the plain
       instance attributes total_input_tokens / total_output_tokens / num_calls,
       causing infinite RecursionError on every counter access.
    B. distil_and_update: corrected `_DISTILLATION_SYSTEM` → `DISTILLATION_SYSTEM`.
    C. distil_and_update: corrected `self._parse_template` → `self.parse_template`.
    D. BoT.run() / __repr__: corrected `self._buffer_manager` → `self.buffer_manager`
       and `self._meta_buffer` → `self.meta_buffer`.
    E. BoT: removed the @property stubs for meta_buffer / buffer_manager that
       returned non-existent private names (_meta_buffer / _buffer_manager).
    F. MetaBuffer.load(): now handles empty JSON files gracefully instead of
       raising JSONDecodeError.
