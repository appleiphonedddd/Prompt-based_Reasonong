"""
Graph of Thoughts (GoT) Prompting Implementation.

GoT models LLM reasoning as an arbitrary directed graph G = (V, E),
where each vertex is an LLM thought and each directed edge represents
a dependency between thoughts.  This generalises Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
and Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) by enabling three graph-native transformations:

  1. Generate  – branch one thought into k new thoughts.
  2. Aggregate – merge k thoughts into one combined thought.
  3. Refine    – loop over a thought to iteratively improve it.

The concrete execution schedule is determined by a Graph of Operations
(GoO).  For general question-answering the default GoO is:

  Phase 0 – Generate k independent reasoning paths.
  Phase 1 – Score every path.
  Phase 2 – KeepBest N paths.
  Phase 3 – Aggregate the survivors into a single answer.
  Phase 4 – Refine the aggregate answer (optional, repeat r times).

This is the same decompose → solve → merge pattern described in §4 of
the paper, adapted to generic Q&A rather than the sorting use-case.
